# CSC 251 Final Project: Port Scanner

## Necessary files

The only file required to run the port scanner is `port_scanner.py`.

## Instructions

- Install the `scapy` module for packet manipulation:

  ```bash
  pip install scapy
  ```

- Install `pytz` to view the timezone shown in the port scanner output:

  ```bash
  pip install pytz
  ```

- To run the port scanner, from the terminal (MacOS/Linux) or command prompt (Windows):

  ```bash
  python3 port_scanner.py -mode [normal/syn/fin] -order [order/random] -ports [all/known] [ip_address]
  ```

- Notes about testing the port scanner:
  - The target IP address to be tested on is **131.229.72.13**.
  - The target hostname to be tested on is **glasgow.smith.edu**.
  - Order of options (`-mode`, `-order`, `-ports`) does not matter.
  - _IMPORTANT_: This port scanner is only intended to scan the host specified above. It is important that the port scanner should not be misused (i.e. to scan other hosts without permission.)

## Challenges & how to overcome

- One major challenge that I faced in this project is that my unfamiliarity with using the `socket` module for socket programming and the `scapy` module for packet manipulation.
  - However, there is quite a number of online resources (especially those with diagrams to illustrate the differences between the 3 scanning modes), which I think I was able to utilize well to complete this final project.
  - Also, reviewing my previous coding assignments that involved using `socket` and `scapy` did help too.
- I used the `argparse` module but didn't have a whole lot of experience with it, and it took me a bit at the beginning of the project to grasp what I need to do to construct the correct arguments for the command line.
  - Reading the Python documentation on `argparse` helped a lot.
