# Port Scanner

## Necessary files

The only file required to run this port scanner is `port_scanner.py`.

## Instructions

### Installing necessary modules

- Install the `scapy` module for packet manipulation:

  ```bash
  pip install scapy
  ```

- Install the `pytz` module to view the timezone shown in the port scanner output:

  ```bash
  pip install pytz
  ```

- Other than that, the remaining modules used in this program are pre-installed in Python, and do not need to be installed using `pip`.

### Running the port scanner

- To run the port scanner, from the terminal (MacOS/Linux) or command prompt (Windows):

  ```bash
  python3 port_scanner.py -mode [normal/syn/fin] -order [order/random] -ports [all/known] -target_ip [ip_address]
  ```

- Notes about testing the port scanner:

  - The IP address of the target host to be tested on is **131.229.72.13**.
  - The target hostname is **glasgow.smith.edu**.
  - Order of the arguments does not matter. However, it is important to include the corresponding flags (`-mode`, `-order`, `-ports`, `-target_ip`) in front of the arguments, like what is demonstrated in the command line above.
  - Doing multiple rounds of testing at once might cause the host to be down (`WARNING: Mac address to reach destination not found. Using broadcast.`). A suggestion is to wait a bit and then run the port scanner again.
  - **IMPORTANT: This port scanner is only intended to scan the host specified above. It is important that the port scanner should not be misused (i.e. to scan other hosts without permission.)**

- Expected results:

  - Here is an example of what the output looks like when running the port scanner on a valid host:

  ```bash
  python3 port_scanner.py -mode syn -order order -ports known 131.229.72.13
  ```

  ```

  - Additionally, here is an example of what the output looks like when running the port scanner on an invalid host:

  ```bash
  python3 port_scanner.py -mode syn -order random -ports known 131.229.72.1300000
  ```

  ```
